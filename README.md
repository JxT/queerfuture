# Website for my MSc project, QueerFuture

## What is this?
A website designed and coded in about a week to explain my MSc research project, QueerFuture, and let participants sign up!

## What is/was QueerFuture?
Research looking at new ways of participatory design - with the aim of empowering queer people in the tech they use! To learn more, search for 'Queer HCI' - there's a wealth of knowledge out there ^^
